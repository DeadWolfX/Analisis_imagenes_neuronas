<h2>Project description</h2>
<h3>This project is designed to work with batches of RGB immunolabeled neuron images:</h3>
<b>Green channel:</b> contain the information of the label for neurons.
<b>Blue channel:</b> contain the information of the label neurons nuclei.
<b>Red channel:</b> contain the information of the label of neurons expressing c-fos.

In this project, a Jupyter Lab notebook is proposed to facilitate decision-making in the generation of masks that contain regions expressing markers in the three channels for stitched images. This was developed to support a master's thesis research.
